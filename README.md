# Dummy-python-project
Hi!
This is a simple Python project that reads numbers from a text file and calculates their sum.

## Project Files
- `sum_numbers.py`: The main script that performs the calculation.
- `numbers.txt`: A sample file (you can create your own) containing numbers, each on a separate line.

## How to Use
1. Place the numbers in a `.txt` file, each number on a new line.
2. Run the script and enter the path to the `.txt` file when prompted.

### Example Usage
```bash
python3 sum_numbers.py
Enter the file path of the text file with numbers: numbers.txt
The sum of numbers is: 100
